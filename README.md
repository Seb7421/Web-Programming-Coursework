# Web-Programming-Coursework
During my first year at Loughborough University I was required to design and implement a website for the Web-Programming module.

I achieved 85% for this coursework.

This website application is a wedding venue finder website which conects to a mySQL database, where the databse stores data regarding different wedding venues.

I have designed and programmed the website so that it has a user friendly and responsive design.

The website takes as input from the user either a specific date or range of dates that the user might want to book a wedding venue for. The system also takes as input 
the capacity, and catering grade the user wants for their potential wedding venue. 

After the system has validated the input from the user, using PHP and SQL the website connects to a mySQL database. Furthermore using JSon and Ajax the website displays 
the wedding venues that are available on the given days which can host the requested capacity, and cater the requested catering grade. The Ajax allows for the
quick display of the available wedding venues without reloading the webpage.
